DESIGN PATTERNS

CREATIONAL PATTERNS
Creational patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
-------------------
1. SINGLETON is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance,
while providing a global access point to this instance.

2. FACTORY METHOD is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in
a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

3. ABSTRACT FACTORY is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects
without specifying their concrete classes.

4. BUILDER is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step.
The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.
